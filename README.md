# sign-up-form

Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project was a good way to utilize the intermediate HTML and CSS skills I learned: forms, form validation, form styling, positioning, fonts, text styling, regular expressions, and more.

The greatest challenge was with the form validation. I tried the more challenging path of using Javascript for form validation, and I feel like the script I wrote is somewhat clunky, repetitive, and still imperfect. Validation for the "confirm password" input was especially challenging since this was not built into the Constraint Validation API.

Nonetheless, I am pleased with the result, and it was fun to do a project mostly focused on aesthetics/design.
